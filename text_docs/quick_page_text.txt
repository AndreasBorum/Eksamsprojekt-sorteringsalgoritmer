Quicksort is a fast sorting algorithm that works by splitting a large array of data into smaller sub-arrays. This implies that each iteration works by splitting the input into two components, sorting them, and then recombining them.
The quick sort algorithm can be summarized in three steps:

-Pick: Select a pivot.
-Divide: Split the problem set, move smaller parts to the left of the pivot and larger items to the right.
-Repeat and combine: Repeat the steps and combine the arrays that have previously been sorted.
